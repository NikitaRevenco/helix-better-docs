import { T } from "@/termshots/multiple-cursors/index.astro"

One of the most powerful features Helix has is multiple cursor.

Multiple cursors allow you to perform complex refactors which can be broken down to a series of steps, as well as search-and-replace.

The best way to learn is with examples, and we'll provide you with many examples on this page.

## Introduction

We have some HTML which has repeating classes:

<T.HtmlBeginningState />

And we want to change each `px-3` class to `px-4`, as well as each `font-bold` class to `font-thin`:

<T.HtmlFinalState />

---

1. First, begin by placing your cursor on the first `3`:

   <T.CursorOnFirst3 />

1. Press <kbd>C</kbd> which creates a cursor below, until you have a cursor on each individual `3`:

   <T.CursorOnEach3 />

1. Press `r` which will replace the character, and then `4` to replace each of the `3`s with a `4`.

   <T.Each3ReplacedWith4 />

1. Our goal is to change the class `font-bold` to `font-thin`, which you can do by pressing <kbd>bbb</kbd> until each `bold` is highlighted:

   <T.EachBoldIsHighlighted />

1. Press <kbd>c</kbd> to change, and then type `thin` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return back to normal mode.

   <T.EachBoldChangedToThin />

## Choosing a Strategy

There are often many ways to accomplish the same refactoring with different keystrokes in Helix, which provides nice flexibility.

Let's see the same example we have done previously, but in a slightly different manner.

---

1. From the following state:

   <T.HtmlBeginningState />

1. Press <kbd>gw</kbd> to show two letters at the start of each word:

   <T.UsedGotoWord />

1. Navigate to the first instance of the `bold` word by pressing the 2-character key combination, which in our case that would be <kbd>ac</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedFirstBoldWithGw />

1. The entire `bold` word is highlighted now.

   Press <kbd>C</kbd> again 3 times until you select each instance of `bold`:

   <T.EachBoldIsHighlightedAgain />

1. As you see, the visual selection gets transferred over!

   Change the contents of each selection by using <kbd>c</kbd> to delete and enter insert mode -- then type `thin` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return back to normal mode.

   <T.EachBoldChangedToThinAgain />

1. Press <kbd>f</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> to find the next 3:

   <T.EntirePxClassHighlighted />

1. We could delete the entire `px-3` class if we wanted.

   Instead press <kbd>a</kbd> to append at the end of each selection, which puts us into insert mode.

   <T.InsertModeAfterEachPxClass />

1. Delete the 3 by pressing backspace, then add a 4, exiting back to insert mode with <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

   <T.FinalTransformationAgain />

As you become more familiar, you'll learn to pick out more efficient ways of accomplishing the same task, and which method is better based upon circumstances.
