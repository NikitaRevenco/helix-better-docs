Surrounds are another useful feature of Helix which allow you to perform common actions such as:

- Surround selection with character
- Replace surrounding character
- Delete surrounding character

You can use any character for a surround add, replace or delete operation -- such as `x`.

Some surround characters are more advanced, for having a selecting and surrounding it with `(` with add `(` at the beginning of the selection and `)` at the end.

## Surround selection with character

You can surround selections with specific characters with <kbd>ms</kbd> for _**m**ake **s**urrounding_. For example, with the following state:

<T.SurroundSelectionInit />

Pressing <kbd>ms(</kbd>, you surround the selection with `(`:

<T.SurroundSelection />

## Replace surrounding character

But what if we actually meant to surround it with `{` instead? That's fine! We can _**m**ake **r**eplace_ the surrounding character with <kbd>mr</kbd>

For instance, <kbd>mr(\{</kbd> replaces the surrounding `(` with a `{`:

<T.ReplaceSurrounding />

## Delete surrounding character

If we wanted to delete the surrounding character, we could also use <kbd>md</kbd> for _**m**ake **d**elete_. For example to delete the nearest surrounding pair of `{`, use <kbd>md\{</kbd>.

<T.DeleteSurrounding />

## List of surrounds

Helix has support for the following pairs of surrounds:

- `{` and `}`
- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `<` and `>`

## Use any character

You can also use any other character which will act on the literal characters. For instance, if we have a markdown file like follows:

<T.MarkdownInit />

1. Pressing <kbd>md*</kbd> will delete the nearest `*`.

<T.DeleteSurroundingAsterisk />

1. Using <kbd>mro\{</kbd> will replace the nearest pairs of `o` character with `{`:

<T.ReplaceSurroundingO />

## Next steps

With [multiple cursors](/usage/multiple-cursors), [macros](/usage/macros), [text objects](/usage/text-objects) and finally surround you now have all of the most important tools for efficiently working with text.

Let's learn how to configure editor tooling next, with setting up [language support](/usage/language-support).
