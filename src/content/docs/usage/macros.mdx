Now that you've learned how to [refactor text using multiple cursors](/usage/multiple-cursors), the next step is to learn about macros and how to effectively use them for complex refactorings.

## Introduction

Macros are a way to record your keystrokes and then replay them whenever you want to.

The two most important keys here are:

- <kbd>Q</kbd> which begins recording a macro into the [register](/start-here/basics#registers) `Q`.
- <kbd>q</kbd> which replays the macro from register `Q`.

You can have a lot of macros at your disposal in various registers, ready to use whenever. You use registers with macros just like usual.

For example, to record a macro into a specific register, press <kbd>"</kbd> to select the register, then a character which will be the register where your macro is stored, and then <kbd>Q</kbd>. For instance:

- <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to record a macro into the `e` register.

To stop recording, press `Q` again.

Replay the macro by using register + <kbd>q</kbd>. For example:

- <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>

## Using macros

1. Place your cursor on the first line, after the dash:

   <T.CursorAfterDash />

1. Use <kbd>Q</kbd> to begin recording a macro, and press <kbd>e</kbd> to select the full `thin` word:

   <T.RecordingMacroBegins />

1. Change it to `bold` using <kbd>c</kbd> to delete and insert mode, then type `bold` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal mode:

   <T.ChangedThinToBoldMacro />

1. Use <kbd>f</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> to find to next 3, and then <kbd>;</kbd> to collapse selection to a single cursor in order to select the `3`:

   <T.SelectedFirst3 />

1. Replace it with a `4` using <kbd>r</kbd> to enter replace mode which waits for the next character, and type `4`:

   <T.Replaced3With4 />

1. Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to stop recording the macro.

   <T.FinishedRecordingMacro />

1. Okay, so the hard part is done!

   Now go back to the `-` you started from by using <kbd>F</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> which finds the previous `-`.

   Repeat this motion by using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> and then collapse selection with <kbd>;</kbd>:

   <T.BackToTheBeginning />

1. Hit <kbd>j</kbd> to go down a line and create 2 more cursors on each `-` by pressing <kbd>C</kbd> 2 more times:

   <T.Created3MoreCursors />

1. And just press <kbd>q</kbd> (note the lowercase q) to repeat the motions you've recorded earlier.

   <T.FinalStateWithMacros />

## Search and Select

We've just explored the very basics of how to use multiple cursors and macros, but in fact they're a lot more powerful than seems at first glance.

Let's consider the following file, which includes some repetition:

<T.PythonBeginningState />

And we want every variable to be a maximum of 3 characters, and functions to be static methods on a class.

The final outcome will look like this:

<T.PythonFinalState />

---

1. First, let's rename each of the functions from `calculate_*` to `get_*`.

   The easiest way to do search-and-replace in Helix is to first select the entire file with <kbd>%</kbd>.

   <T.SelectedFullPythonFile />

1. We're going to use <kbd>s</kbd> which allows us to _**s**elect_ inside of our selection.

   Basically, it takes an input and will search for that input and create a cursor everywhere it finds it.

   <T.UsedSToSelectInsideSelection />

1. Type the following: `calculate` and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   <T.TypedCalculate />

   As you see, it created a selection and a cursor on every single instance of the `calculate` word.

   We can now just press <kbd>c</kbd> to delete the contents of each selection, which also places us into insert mode, and type `get` then <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal more:

   <T.ReplacedEachCalculateWithGet />

1. Now that we have a cursor on each function definition, lets create an empty line above each cursor by pressing <kbd>O</kbd> and then writing `@staticmethod`, finally going back to normal mode with <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

   <T.AddedStaticMethodIndicator />

1. Our goal is to rename the parameters to be 3 letters.

   To do this, we're going to first select the function definition as well as the first line of the body of each function, with <kbd>j</kbd> and then by using <kbd>x</kbd> twice:

   <T.SelectedFirstTwoLinesOfEachFunction />

1. Let's use <kbd>s</kbd> now which will ask us for a prompt.

   This time, we won't just enter a string but we'll enter a very small regex: `\w+`, which selects every word:

   <T.SelectedEveryWord />

1. This selected a few extra words than we wanted, but that's okay! One of the selections is the "primary" selection which we can tell by the `2:3` in the left right corner, which means that our primary selection is on line 2 character 3.

   We can make the next selection our primary selection by using <kbd>)</kbd>, which is seen by the `2:12` in the counter, meaning that our primary selection is at the `get_area` method:

   <T.NextSelectionPrimary />

   We can go back to the previous one with <kbd>(</kbd>:

   <T.BackToPreviousSelection />

1. By pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>, we can remove the primary selection, so that `def` is not selected:

   <T.RemovedPrimarySelection />

1. Removing that selection automatically made `get_area` the next selected region. We don't want this one either, so we'll remove it again with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>:

   <T.RemovedPrimarySelectionAgain />

   Press <kbd>)</kbd> a few times until you reach the next selection you want to remove. If you go over by one, just press <kbd>(</kbd> to make the previous selection primary.

1. Let's repeat the previous step until we _only_ have the words `length`, `width` and `height` selected:

   <T.OnlyParamsSelected />

1. At this point, we can begin our removal process.

   Go to the beginning of each word by pressing <kbd>b</kbd>, and then press <kbd>l</kbd> a couple of times until you are on the 4th character of each word:

   <T.OnFourthCharOfEachWord />

1. Let's press <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end of each word which will highlight it:

   <T.SelectEndOfEachParam />

1. Press <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it.

   <T.DeletedEndOfEachWord />

1. Great we're almost there!

   Let's actually undo this step so that we can look at an alternative way of accomplishing the same result.

   Press `u` just once which will undo our replacement:

   <T.UndidStep />

1. An alternative way is to select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedEntireFileAgain />

1. With the power of <kbd>s</kbd> and Regex, we can select the `length`, `width` and `height` words by chaining them together with the "OR" operator.

   For instance, type the following: `length|width|height`:

   <T.SelectedAllLengthWidthHeight />

   This is certainly simpler but it's good to know both approaches.

1. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select and go to the beginning of each word with <kbd>b</kbd>

1. Move 3 characters to the right with <kbd>lll</kbd>
1. Press <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end of each word and delete it:

   <T.RemovedLastPartOfEachParam />

1. Lets to remove the variable declarations of `result` on each line, and instead directly return the calculation.

   Go ahead and select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd> then use the <kbd>s</kbd> to bring up the select prompt again.

1. Type `result =` which will select all instances of `result =`:

   <T.SelectedAllResultVars />

1. <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select, and then Press <kbd>C</kbd> to duplicate the selection on each line:

   <T.SelectedAllResultVarsAndC />

1. By using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>(</kbd>, we can rotate the _contents_ of the selection backward:

   <T.RotatedContentsOfSelections />

   Try using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> to rotate the selection forward. You can keep on pressing the key but the difference between <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>(</kbd> won't be obvious in this example, since we basically have the same selections repeated.

   Regardless, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> at least once to get into the following state:

   <T.RotatedContentsOfSelections />

1. Collapse each cursor so that there is only a single selection with <kbd>;</kbd>:

   <T.EachSelectionCollapsed />

1. Now, just press <kbd>d</kbd> twice to delete two characters on each of the 6 lines:

   <T.DeletedTwoChars />

1. Okay so at this point, we are _almost_ there. We just need to delete the `result sult` line.

   To do this, use the <kbd>s</kbd> again and type `s` in the prompt. This will select the `s` in each of your selections and place a cursor there:

   <T.SelectedAllS />

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select, and then press <kbd>x</kbd> to select the entire line and <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it. Voila!

   <T.Deleted3Lines />

1. We've got just a few steps left. Namely, select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedEntireFileAgain2 />

1. Press <kbd>\></kbd> which will indent everything by 1 level. We need this since we're going to nest it in a class, after all. You can also use <kbd>\<</kbd> to de-dent the selection by 1 level too.

   <T.IndentAllBy1Level />

1. Now, press <kbd>O</kbd> to create a newline above and enter Insert mode.

1. Finally, type `class Calculator:` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal mode.

   <T.FinalStatePython />

We've accomplished our goal ðŸ¥³!
