Text Objects are a way to manipulate a piece of text in a structured way. They allow you to refer to blocks of text based on their purpose and perform powerful actions. For instance:

- Selecting inside of a function.
- Select the next argument.
- Select the next changed text tracked by git.
- Select the previous type.

Notice that in each item in the above list we _select_ something? This builds upon the idea that we talked about in the [selection-first approach](/start-here/basics#selection-first-approach) section.

Text objects allow us to use this mechanism to be even more productive.

## Using Text Objects

For example, with the following Python file:

<T.InitialPythonFile />

### Basic Example

1. Move your cursor in the `__init__` method, and press <kbd>maf</kbd> for _**m**atch **a**round **f**unction_ to select the entire method:

   <T.SelectedInitMethod />

1. Use <kbd>mif</kbd> for _**m**atch **i**nside **f**unction_ to select the body of the method:

   <T.SelectedInsideInitMethod />

1. Additionally, you can move between most text objects.

   For instance, use <kbd>]f</kbd> with go to the previous function.

   <T.MoveToNextMethod />

### Syntax

- <kbd>mi</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**atch **i**nside_ a textobject. Highlight a smaller region of the text object, for example the body of a function.
- <kbd>ma</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**atch **a**round_ a textobject. Selects the entire text object, which usually includes surrounding whitespace.
- <kbd>]</kbd> + `<textobject>` to go to the next instance of the textobject.
- <kbd>[</kbd> + `<textobject>` to go to the previous instance of the textobject.

### List of Text Objects

- `p`, `w` and `W`: [primitive text objects](#primitive)
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `<`, `>`, `'`, `"` and `` ` ``: [pair text objects](#pair-text-objects)
- `g`: [git hunk](#git-hunk)
- `f`, `t`, `a`, `c`, `T`, `g`: [tree-sitter text objects](#tree-sitter-text-objects)

#### Primitive

##### word

A word consists only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, so `a-Z`, `0-9` and `_`.

For instance, take the following file, with two cursors:

<T.RustInitialState />

1. Match inside word with <kbd>miw</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedInsideWord />

1. Matching around word with <kbd>maw</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedAroundWord />

Note that we now also have the space before the `world` as our selection!

##### WORD

A WORD is always delimited by whitespace such as newlines, tabs and spaces.

Consider this file again:

<T.RustInitialState />

1. Match inside WORD with <kbd>miW</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedInsideBigWord />

1. Matching around WORD with <kbd>maW</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedAroundBigWord />

Note that the first selection was `println!("Hey, ` and the second selection is ` world!");`, since these selections share a common character (the space), they essentially merge.

##### Paragraph

A paragraph is delimited by two newlines, as well as start and end of files. For example in the following file with 3 cursors:

<T.MarkdownFile />

1. Match inside paragarph with <kbd>mip</kbd>:

   <T.MarkdownFileSelectParagraphs />

1. Match around paragraph with <kbd>map</kbd>:

   <T.MarkdownFileSelectAroundParagraphs />

#### Pair Text Objects

These allow you to select:

- Inside of the surrounding pair, excluding the surrounding characters
- Inside of the surrounding pair, including the surrounding characters

For example, with the following state:

<T.TypescriptFile />

1. Pressing <kbd>mi(</kbd> will select:

   <T.TypescriptFileInsideParentheses />

1. While <kbd>ma(</kbd> will select:

   <T.TypescriptFileAroundParentheses />

Full list of available pairs:

- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `{` and `}`
- `<` and `>`
- `'` and `'`
- `"` and `"`
- `` ` `` and `` ` ``

#### Git Hunk

If you are in a repository, then you will also have the `g` for _**g**it hunk_ textobject.

It will select the entire change.

For instance, if we have the following file, with the added lines visible by the green bar indicator on the gutter:

<T.GitHunkExample />

Using <kbd>mig</kbd> will select the git hunk:

<T.GitHunkSelected />

#### Tree-sitter Text Objects

Available for most languages, specifically ones with text objects support. See the [full list of all languages with configured text object queries](/help/language-defaults).

To find out for your language from the terminal, run `hx --health <language>`. If queries for a specific language like python are available, running `hx --health python` will show:

```ansi
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“
```

List of available text objects:

- `f` for _**f**unction_
- `t` for _**t**ype_
- `a` for _**a**rgument_
- `c` for _**c**omment_
- `T` for _**T**est_

## Syntax-aware Motions

Some commands allow you to move the selection according to its location in the syntax tree. For example, many languages have the following syntax for function calls:

<T.SyntaxAwareInit />

1. If you use <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>, it will select the next sibling:

   <T.NextSibling />

1. Similarly, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> selects the previous sibling:

   <T.PrevSibling />

1. <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> will expand selection to the parent node:

   <T.ParentNode />

Now that you have text objects in your toolkit, you've mostly learned the most useful text manipulation features of Helix.
