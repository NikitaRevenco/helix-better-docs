import { T } from "@/termshots/basics/index.astro";

To get started check out the [installation instructions](/start-here/installation) in order to follow along with the tutorial.

### Opening a file

Create a new text file and open it with Helix by running `hx file.txt`. This is what you'll see:

<T.OpeningFile />

Notice the `NOR` in the bottom-left corner, this indicates that you are currently in Normal mode. In this mode, typing letters like <kbd>e</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> won't insert them as text, but rather have specific _commands_ which we will explore later.

To actually insert some text, press <kbd>i</kbd>, which is the command to get into Insert mode, indicated by the `INS` in the bottom-left corner. In this mode, the letters you type will be inserted directly into the document.

Try it out by writing `Hello helix!`.

<T.InsertMode />

To get back into Normal mode press <kbd>Esc</kbd>. This will change the color of your cursor and you will see `NOR` again, indicating that you are in normal mode now.

### Movement

To move your cursor you could use arrow keys, both in Normal and Insert modes:

- <kbd>↑</kbd> move cursor up
- <kbd>↓</kbd> move cursor down
- <kbd>→</kbd> moves cursor right
- <kbd>←</kbd> moves cursor left

However, this isn't encouraged due to the fact that hand will be doing a lot of back-and-forth movement between the arrow keys and the keyboard.

Instead, it is recommended to rest your fingers on the "home row", which is comprised of the row of keys `a s d f g h j k l`.

Instead of stretching to reach the arrow keys, use normal mode and <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> to move your cursor:

- <kbd>h</kbd>: moves cursor 1 character to the left.
- <kbd>j</kbd>: moves cursor 1 line above.
- <kbd>k</kbd>: moves cursor 1 line below.
- <kbd>l</kbd>: moves cursor 1 character to the right.

Try holding down <kbd>h</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> to move horizontally across the text you just wrote!

:::tip

The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is quite far away from the home row on most keyboards. Due to this fact, many people remap <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> to <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

You can find out how to do this in [Remap Caps Lock to Escape](/help/recipes#remap-caps-lock-to-escape).

:::

### Paste

We only have one line of text, so let's duplicate it several times. Type:

- <kbd>x</kbd>, which will select the entire line.
- <kbd>y</kbd>, which will _**y**ank_ (copy) the selection to clipboard.
- <kbd>p</kbd>, which will paste the contents of the selection after the cursor.

Spam <kbd>p</kbd> a few times to create several lines.

<T.SeveralLines />

Now you can try using the <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> motions to traverse the text!

### Word-based Movement

Let's say we want to replace one of the `helix` words with `world`. To do this, place your cursor on one of the <kbd>h</kbd> letters:

<T.OneOfTheHLetters />

<kbd>e</kbd> is a motion which moves to the _**e**nd_ of the current word. Type <kbd>e</kbd> and it will move your cursor to the end of the `helix`.

It doesn't just move your cursor there, though. The entire `helix` word becomes highlighted:

<T.EntireHelixWordHighlighted />

If we now press <kbd>b</kbd>, which moves to the _**b**eginning_ of the current word, it'll move us back to where we just were.

Try this out a few times, press <kbd>e</kbd> and then <kbd>b</kbd> to select various sections of the text. If you want to remove your selection press <kbd>;</kbd>.

Let's highlight our `helix` word again:

<T.EntireHelixWordHighlighted />

### Selection-first Approach

Helix's philosophy is that each **action** will act on a selection.

Every time text is modified (an **action**), you will fully anticipate the result -- because you can clearly see the area of text which is highlighted, and thus will be modified.

For example, we currently have the word `helix` selected. To change it to `world`, press <kbd>c</kbd>,

<T.HelixChangedToHello />

<kbd>c</kbd> removes the contents of the current selection and places us in Insert mode, where you can then write your new word. Exit back to Normal mode by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd>.

<T.HelixChangedToWorld />

### Delete

The <kbd>d</kbd> command deletes the current selection and copies what has been deleted into a clipboard.

Let's test it out by doing the following:

1. Select the line we just changed with <kbd>x</kbd>.

   <T.SelectedLineWeJustChanged />

1. <kbd>d</kbd> to delete this line.

   <T.SelectedLineDeleted />

1. Spam <kbd>p</kbd> a few times to create some duplicates.

   <T.SelectedLineDuplicated />

Let's remove all of our previous `Hello helix!` by doing the following for each `Hello helix!` line:

1. Select the line with <kbd>x</kbd>.
1. <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it.

Now we have something like this:

<T.HelloHelixLinesRemoved />

### Undo and Redo

What if we made a mistake, and want to go back? The <kbd>u</kbd> command will _**u**ndo_ our most recent action. It's similar to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> in other editors.

Try pressing down <kbd>u</kbd> a few times to get to our previous state, before we made all those modifications:

<T.PressedUAFewTimes />

<kbd>U</kbd> is similar to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> in other editors. It will _undo the last undo_. It's the inverse of <kbd>u</kbd>.

Press <kbd>U</kbd> until we get back to our most recent state:

<T.BackToMostRecentState />

### Checkpoint

Feel free to make modifications to your file using the commands we have learned so far:

- <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> moves 1 character left, down, up and right.
- <kbd>i</kbd> enters Insert mode.
- <kbd>esc</kbd> enters Normal mode.
- <kbd>x</kbd> selects the entire line.
- <kbd>y</kbd> yanks the selection.
- <kbd>p</kbd> pastes the recently copied selection.
- <kbd>e</kbd> selects and moves to the end of the current word.
- <kbd>b</kbd> selects and moves to the beginning of the current word.
- <kbd>;</kbd> removes the extra selection.
- <kbd>d</kbd> deletes the current selection, without exiting Normal mode.
- <kbd>c</kbd> changes the current selection, by deleting it and entering Insert mode.
- <kbd>u</kbd> will undo the most recent change.
- <kbd>U</kbd> will undo the most recent undo.

Once you are happy with your modifications, enter Normal mode and type <kbd>:</kbd>.

<kbd>:</kbd> enters _command mode_, which has commands you type out.

- `:w` will _**w**rite_ the current file.
- `:q` will _**q**uit_ the current file.
- `:q!` will quit without saving.
- `:wq` will both write and quit.

<T.WriteQuitAll />

## More Commands

Let's try out more Helix commands! Open the file again with `hx file.txt`. Select the entire file by pressing <kbd>%</kbd>

<T.FullFileSelected />

Now, delete the selection with <kbd>d</kbd>.

<T.FullFileDeleted />

### Goto Word

Using <kbd>b</kbd> to go to the beginning of the word and <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end is useful if you are already at the word you want. But if you are far away, a very powerful command is _**g**oto **w**ord_ -- <kbd>gw</kbd>.

<T.GotoWordShowcase />

<kbd>gw</kbd> will create two letters at the start of every word in sight. When you type those two letters, you instantly jump to the specified word.

Let's say we want to jump to the `plates` word. The first two characters have been replaced by `at` and highlighted. If we write `at`, we will highlight that word!

<T.HighlightedPlatesWordWithGotoWord />

### Replace

You can also replace a selection with contents of a register.

1. Select the `moon` word by using <kbd>gw</kbd> and yank it with <kbd>y</kbd>.
2. Select the `sun` word and replace it with `moon` with <kbd>R</kbd>.

### Search

Go to the first line by using <kbd>gg</kbd>.

To search for a word, use <kbd>/</kbd> command. Type `will` which is going to highlight the next `will` keyword, and then <kbd>Enter ↵</kbd> to select it.

Since there are several `will`s in the text, you can cycle between them:

- <kbd>n</kbd> cycles to the next match.
- <kbd>N</kbd> cycles to the previous match.

### More ways to enter Insert Mode

Select the `clouds` word using <kbd>gw</kbd>. If you press <kbd>i</kbd>, you will go into insert mode at the beginning of the selection. There are also 5 more ways to enter Insert mode:

- <kbd>a</kbd> for _**append**_ go into insert mode at the end of the selection
- <kbd>I</kbd> go into insert mode at the beginning of the current line
- <kbd>A</kbd> to append at the end of the current line
- <kbd>o</kbd> add a newline below and go into insert mode
- <kbd>O</kbd> add a newline above and go into insert mode

Try all of them out!

### Registers

Helix has a concept called _registers_, which is like having many clipboards at once.

To interact with them, prefix yank and delete commands with a <kbd>"</kbd> and then the name of the register.

For example, the contents of the system clipboard are stored inside the `+` register.

:::note

On linux, you may need a clipboard provider like [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) to use the system clipboard.

:::

1. Paste the following content into the file with <kbd>"+p</kbd>:

   ```
   The plates will
   and the clouds will
   The sun will
   and the moon will
   ```

1. Navigate to the last line by using <kbd>ge</kbd> for _**g**oto end_.

   <T.GotoLastLine />

1. Select the last line with <kbd>x</kbd> and then yank it with <kbd>y</kbd>.

   <T.CopiedLastLine />

1. Navigate to the second line by using <kbd>2gg</kbd>.
1. Select the second line by using <kbd>x</kbd> and then yank into into the <kbd>e</kbd> register with <kbd>"ey</kbd>.

   <T.CopiedSecondLineIntoERegister />

1. Navigate to the third line by using <kbd>3gg</kbd>.
1. Paste what we copied previously by using <kbd>p</kbd>.

   <T.PastedPreviouslyCopied />

Notice how we haven't pasted the 2nd line's contents, but rather the last lines'? Because we yanked the 2nd line's contents into the <kbd>e</kbd> register. To paste from it, use <kbd>"ep</kbd>.

- <kbd>"</kbd> signals to the editor that we are going to use a register.
- <kbd>e</kbd> uses the <kbd>e</kbd> register.
- <kbd>p</kbd> pastes contents of the <kbd>e</kbd> register.

<T.PastedFromERegister />

Take note of the fact that when we press <kbd>p</kbd>, it pastes the contents of the register _after_ the line. To paste _before_, we undo with <kbd>u</kbd> and use <kbd>P</kbd> to paste before.

<T.PastedFromERegisterBefore />

### Move to characters

You can also search for individual characters by using <kbd>t</kbd>, which stands for _**t**ill_.

1. Copy the text below

   ```
   Twilight fades; stars—whispering, bold—
   "Hope," they hum; yet shadows unfold...
   Life? A riddle—endless! Who'll dare,
   to seek; to dream: to wander—where?
   ```

1. Select the entire file with <kbd>%</kbd>
1. Override the selection by using <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.

:::tip

Instead of writing <kbd>"+</kbd> to interact with the system clipboard every time, you can also prefix paste and delete motion with <kbd>Space</kbd>. For example, <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> has the same effect as <kbd>"+p</kbd>.

:::

Go to the first line with <kbd>gg</kbd> and use <kbd>t;</kbd> to go to the next semicolon. Repeat this several several times.

To move in the opposite direction, use <kbd>T;</kbd> to the previous semicolon.

Using <kbd>t</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd> motions will move your cursor _to just before_ the next or the previous occurrence of the character.

For example, <kbd>te</kbd> to go to the next e. <kbd>T"</kbd> to go to just before the previous double-quote.

The <kbd>f</kbd> for _**f**ind_ is similar to <kbd>t</kbd>, but instead it places your cursor _at_ the occurrence of the character. Try using <kbd>f;</kbd> several times. <kbd>F</kbd> goes the opposite way.

:::tip

By using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>, you can repeat the last <kbd>t</kbd>, <kbd>T</kbd>, <kbd>f</kbd> or <kbd>F</kbd> motion.

:::

### Counts

Each motion also accepts an optional _count_, which defaults to 1 if you don't provide it.

- For example, use <kbd>2f;</kbd> which would be the same as <kbd>f;f;</kbd>.
- Or <kbd>7b</kbd> which would be the same as <kbd>bbbbbbb</kbd>.

### Page Navigation

Currently the text is fairly short, but we can fix that. Select everything with <kbd>%</kbd>, yank <kbd>y</kbd> and then paste it 100 times with <kbd>100p</kbd>. This will create a very big file.

We can use these commands to scroll large chunks of text at once:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> to scroll down half a page
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd> to scroll up half a page
