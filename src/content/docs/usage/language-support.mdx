description: Learn how to configure language servers and auto formatting in Helix

Helix implements the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) which allows support for loved language-specific features such as:

- Intellisense
- Goto Definition
- View documentation on hover
- Workspace symbol search
- Diagnostics

 What is an "LSP"?
</summary>

Historically, each individual editor had to implement a set of tools for each individual language.

This was chaotic and meant that there was an extremely high cost to developing a text editor with features such as goto definition, intellisense, documentation on hover and diagnostics.

Thankfully, with the introduction of the LSP everything changed -- as it standardized a means of communications between editors and languages.

Nowadays, instead of editors having to implement support for _every language in existence_, they just need to implement one feature -- the LSP.

Third parties will each create a _language server_, which provides functionalities for a specific language.

The implementor of the LSP communicates with all of those language servers to provide desired editor functionality.

As a bonus, this significantly reduced the barrier of entry to have great editor tooling per-language. Do you use some obscure language that no one has heard about since the 90s at your work? Consider [implementing a language server](https://tamerlan.dev/how-to-build-a-language-server-with-go/) for it to make your life easier.

Default configurations for languages are available for [many _many_ languages](/help/language-defaults#language-support), and [you can also add your own](/contributing/languages).

In this guide we'll explore how to setup language server for Go, as well as formatting on save. The process will be similar for other languages.

First, let's check what we need to add Go support. Use `hx --health <language>` to check the status of `go`. For example:

```sh
hx --health go
```

Since we've just recently installed Helix, we haven't set anything up yet.

```ansi
Configured language servers:
 [31mâœ˜[0m gopls: [31m'gopls' not found in $PATH[0m
 [31mâœ˜[0m jedi-language-server: [31m'golangci-lint-langserver' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured debug adapter: [32mdlv[0m
Binary for debug adapter: [31m'dlv' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured formatter: [33mNone[0m
Highlight queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Indent queries: [32mâœ“[0m
```

Despite the fact, syntax highlighting is available out of the box with **_zero_** configuration. Neat!

## Language Server

Helix tells us that `gopls` is already configured, even though we haven't installed it. Install it using your operating system's package manager!

After installing it, let's check `hx --health` yet again:

```ansi
Configured language servers:
 [32mâœ“[0m gopls: [32m/path/to/gopls[0m
 [31mâœ˜[0m jedi-language-server: [31m'golangci-lint-langserver' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured debug adapter: [32mdlv[0m
Binary for debug adapter: [31m'dlv' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured formatter: [33mNone[0m
Highlight queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Indent queries: [32mâœ“[0m
```

Helix is able to recognize the path of the `gopls` we've installed. At this point language features like intellisense will _just work_, as Helix configures them by default.

## Formatter

Language support is useful, but over the years most people have stopped manually formatting code and let that job be automated by tools called formatters.

Formatters take your file as input, and adjust _insignificant whitespace_ to conform it to certain standards. Examples of formatters include [biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) and [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).

Let's configure a formatter for Go which will perform its job every time we save the file. One of the popular formatters for Go is called [`gofumpt`](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt), so we'll _go_ with it.

Install `gofumpt` with your operating system's package manager, similar to how you've installed the language server (`gopls`) previously.

To configure `gopls` to format on save, create a `languages.toml` file in your helix config directory, which will vary by operating system:

- Linux and Mac: `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`
- Windows: `%AppData%\helix\languages.toml`

Add the following language entry to the file:

```toml
# languages.toml
[language-server.gopls.config]
gofumpt = true
```

Every time you save your Go files, they will be automatically formatted. For times when this is undesired, see [saving a file without formatting](/help/faq#save-file-without-formatting).

Now go into your Go file and check, formatting and LSP will both work!

## Useful keymaps

To invoke language server functionalities, use the following keymap

Helix includes default keymap for using language server functionality. Some examples:

- <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> renames the symbol under the cursor across the project
- <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> will show documentation for the symbol under the cursor
- <kbd>g</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> brings up a list of symbols referencing the symbol under the cursor

A list of other LSP-related keymappings are available under [goto mode](/reference/keymap#goto-mode) and [space mode](/reference/keymap#space-mode).

## Can't find what you're looking for?

:::tip

If you want to install a language server / formatter which Helix doesn't configure, you've looked at [formatters reference](/reference/formatters) and [language servers reference](/configuration/languages) but found nothing that helps you, a decent next step is to use GitHub's search feature.

In all likelihood, _someone_ has probably created the same setup that you want to have in Helix. A [quick search](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Ahelix%2Flanguages.toml&type=code) on GitHub with the query of `path:helix/languages.toml` yields thousands of results.

If you want to install a formatter like `<whatever>` and feel like you're stuck, then we recommend searching for e.g. `path:helix/languages.toml <whatever>` and looking at the results to find out if any of the code samples you find will help you. In all likelihood, you'll succeed!

Once you figure it out, [please send us a pull request](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/compare) to add it to the docs!
