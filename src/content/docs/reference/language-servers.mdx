description: A list of language servers with default configurations in Helix
---

To see a list of languages with default configurations, see [language defaults](/help/language-defaults)

## Language Server Configurations

### Ansible

If your OS package manager hasn't packaged
[`ansible-language-server`](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/vscode-ansible/als/),
you can install it from NPM:

```sh
npm i -g @ansible/ansible-language-server
```

In turn, this binary will check if `ansible-lint` and `yamllint` are installed
on your system and use them if found.

In addition to highlighting and linting your code, the Ansible language server
can also be used to look up docs for Ansible keywords. With your cursor on a
keyword, use "\<space\>k".

### Astro

https://github.com/withastro/language-tools/tree/main/packages/language-server

```sh
npm i -g @astrojs/language-server
```

Sample settings in `languages.toml`

```toml
[language-server.astro-ls]
command = "astro-ls"
args = ["--stdio"]
config = {
  typescript = {
    tsdk = "/Users/user/.bun/install/global/node_modules/typescript/lib"
  },
  environment = "node"
}

[[language]]
name = "astro"
scope = "source.astro"
injection-regex = "astro"
file-types = ["astro"]
roots = ["package.json", "astro.config.mjs"]
language-servers = [ "astro-ls" ]
```

Please note that a valid `config.typescript.tsdk` path must be passed to the LSP
config.

You will need `typescript` installed. If you have `typescript` installed globally you can find where by running `npm list -g | head -1`.

If you want to install typescript tsdk using your distribution's package manager and not npm, note that the language server will search for a `typescript.js` located in `...somewhere.../lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js`file so you can find out where that is with e.g. `cd / && find typescript.js`.

### AWK

https://github.com/Beaglefoot/awk-language-server

```sh
npm i -g "awk-language-server@>=0.5.2"
```

### Bash

Language server for Bash, written using tree-sitter in TypeScript.

https://github.com/mads-hartmann/bash-language-server

`bash-language-server` can be installed via `NPM`:

```sh
npm i -g bash-language-server
```

### Bass

https://github.com/vito/bass/releases/latest

Bass's language server is built in to the `bass` command as `bass --lsp`. See
the [Guide](https://bass-lang.org/guide.html#getting-started) for more info.

### Bicep

https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest

The Bicep language server is published separately as a Windows package. Download
the bicep-langserver.zip from the releases page.

To run this under Linux/WSL you will need to install the `dotnet` runtime
[for your OS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-nz/dotnet/core/install/linux?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website).

Unzip this in a directory of your choosing for example, `/home/myUser/.cache/`.
Create the following bash script somewhere in your `$PATH`:

`/usr/local/bin/bicep-langserver`

```shell
##!/usr/bin/env bash

exec dotnet /home/myUser/.cache/bicep-langserver/Bicep.LangServer.dll
```

### BQN

bqnlsp: https://git.sr.ht/~detegr/bqnlsp, which depends on:

[cbqn-sys](https://github.com/Detegr/cbqn-sys) and
[cbqn-rs](https://github.com/Detegr/cbqn-rs)

Sample settings in `languages.toml`

```toml
[language-server.bqnlsp]
command = "bqnlsp"

[[language]]
name = "bqn"
file-types = ["bqn"]
comment-token = "#"
indent = { tab-width = 2, unit = "  " }
shebangs = ["bqn", "cbqn"]
roots = []
injection-regex = "bqn"
scope = "scope.bqn"
language-servers = ["bqnlsp"]
language-id = "bqn"
```

Note: you can input the glyphs by
[key remapping](https://docs.helix-editor.com/remapping.html) in `config.toml`
like:

```toml
[keys.insert."\\"]
"=" = [ ":insert-output /bin/echo -n ×", "move_char_right" ]
minus = [ ":insert-output /bin/echo -n ÷", "move_char_right" ]
"+" = [ ":insert-output /bin/echo -n ⋆", "move_char_right" ]
## ...
```

### C/C++

https://clangd.llvm.org/installation.html

**NOTE:** Clang >= 9 is recommended!

clangd relies on a
[JSON compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
specified as `compile_commands.json` or, for simpler projects, a
`compile_flags.txt`. For details on how to automatically generate one using
CMake look
[here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html).
Alternatively, you can use [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear).

### Clojure

Please go to the installation page. https://clojure-lsp.io/installation/

An example for MacOs/Linux (copied from the installation page)

```shell
brew remove clojure-lsp # if you have old clojure-lsp installed via brew
brew install clojure-lsp/brew/clojure-lsp-native
```

### CMake

CMake LSP Implementation.

https://github.com/regen100/cmake-language-server

### Crystal

Core `languages.toml` contains configuration options, view at the top level of
this repo.\
Install the unofficial LSP server
[Crystalline](https://github.com/elbywan/crystalline). Below is copied from the
LSP repo.

###### Linux (x86_64)

```sh
wget https://github.com/elbywan/crystalline/releases/latest/download/crystalline_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.gz -O crystalline.gz &&\
gzip -d crystalline.gz &&\
chmod u+x crystalline
```

####### ArchLinux

```sh
yay -S crystalline
```

###### MacOS

Install using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install crystalline
```

### CSS

https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted

`vscode-css-language-server` can be installed via `npm`:

```sh
npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
```

### C#

https://github.com/omnisharp/omnisharp-roslyn OmniSharp server based on Roslyn
workspaces

`omnisharp-roslyn` can be installed by downloading and extracting a release for
your platform from
[here](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases). Omnisharp can
also be built from source by following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/omnisharp/omnisharp-roslyn#downloading-omnisharp).

Omnisharp requires the [dotnet-sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to be
installed.

#### Usage

##### Linux and Windows

To use Omnisharp, you only need to have the `OmniSharp` binary in your
environment path. The default `languages.toml` configuration should work fine.

##### macOS

Download the `-netX.0` build. Because OmniSharp is not shipped as a binary file,
instead as `OmniSharp.dll`, it needs to be run using `dotnet`. As such the
`languages.toml` config should be changed to this:

```toml
[language-server.omnisharp]
command = "dotnet"
args = [ "path/to/OmniSharp.dll", "--languageserver" ]
```

If the language server immediately exits or otherwise doesn't appear to work,
try running `dotnet restore` and/or `dotnet build` in the current project
directory.

### D

Serve-D.

https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d

Install using `dub fetch serve-d`

### Dart

Language server for dart.

https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analysis_server/tool/lsp_spec

### Deno

Install Deno from https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/

Deno requires custom configuration in `languages.toml` see
https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/14455

```toml
[[language]]
name = "javascript"
shebangs = ["deno"]
roots = ["deno.json", "deno.jsonc"]
file-types = ["js"]
language-servers = ["deno-lsp"]
auto-format = true
[[language]]
name = "typescript"
shebangs = ["deno"]
roots = ["deno.json", "deno.jsonc"]
file-types = ["ts"]
language-servers = ["deno-lsp"]
auto-format = true
[[language]]
name = "jsx"
shebangs = ["deno"]
roots = ["deno.json", "deno.jsonc"]
file-types = ["jsx"]
language-servers = ["deno-lsp"]
auto-format = true
[[language]]
name = "tsx"
shebangs = ["deno"]
roots = ["deno.json", "deno.jsonc"]
file-types = ["tsx"]
language-servers = ["deno-lsp"]
auto-format = true



[language-server.deno-lsp]
command = "deno"
args = ["lsp"]
environment = { NO_COLOR = "1" }

[language-server.deno-lsp.config.deno]
enable = true
## Uncomment to enable completion of unstable features of Deno
## unstable = true
## Uncomment to cache dependencies on save
## cacheOnSave = true
## Enable completion of importing from registries
## Enable completion of function calls
suggest = { completeFunctionCalls = false, imports = { hosts = { "https://deno.land" = true } } }
## suggest = { imports = { hosts = { "https://deno.land" = true, "https://crux.land" = true, "https://x.nest.land" = true } } }
## Uncomment to enable inlay hints
## inlayHints.parameterNames.enabled = "all"
## inlayHints.parameterTypes.enabled = true
## inlayHints.variableTypes.enabled = true
## inlayHints.propertyDeclarationTypes.enabled  = true
## inlayHints.functionLikeReturnTypes.enabled = true
## inlayHints.enumMemberValues.enabled = true
```

Note that some lsp commands are not currently supported, in particular
`go_to_definition` because it requires a Deno lsp extension
https://deno.land/manual/language_server/overview.

### Docker

https://github.com/rcjsuen/dockerfile-language-server-nodejs

`docker-langserver` can be installed via `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g dockerfile-language-server-nodejs
```

### Docker Compose

https://github.com/microsoft/compose-language-service

`docker-compose-langserver` can be installed via `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g @microsoft/compose-language-service
```

### dot Graphviz

https://github.com/nikeee/dot-language-server

```sh
npm i -g dot-language-server
```

### Elixir

https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls

`elixir-ls` can be installed by following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls#building-and-running).

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls/releases/latest/download/elixir-ls.zip
unzip elixir-ls.zip -d /path/to/elixir-ls
## Unix
chmod +x /path/to/elixir-ls/language_server.sh
```

Rename `language_server.sh` to `elixir-ls` and add it to your `$PATH` as this is
how `helix` expects to find it.

###### MacOS

Install using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install elixir-ls
```

### Elm

https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server#installation

```sh
npm install -g elm elm-test elm-format @elm-tooling/elm-language-server
```

### Forth

https://github.com/alexanderbrevig/forth-lsp#install

```sh
cargo install forth-lsp
```

### FSharp/F#

https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete

```sh
dotnet tool install --global fsautocomplete
```

### GDScript

We need to install `nc` or `netcat`. Port 6005 is used in Godot 4.0 beta6. You
will find the right value in the editor configuration panel.

```toml
[language-server.godot]
command = "nc"
args = [ "127.0.0.1", "6005"]

[[language]]
name = "gdscript"
language-servers = [ "godot" ]
```

**For Windows 10/11**

Use `winget` to install `nmap`. This will install `ncat`.

```powershell
winget install nmap
```

Once installed, make sure the folder that `nmap` is now located at is added to
your PATH, as `winget` fails to do this automatically for some people.

In Godot 3.5.1 port used is `6008`. You have to change the command used also.
Instead of `nc` type `ncat` and modify the port. You can find the port when you
open the Godot editor and navigate here:
`Editor -> Editor Settings -> Network -> Language Server -> Remote Port`.

```toml
[language-server.godot]
command = "ncat"
args = [ "127.0.0.1", "6008"]

[[language]]
name = "gdscript"
language-servers = [ "godot" ]
```

### Gleam

Starting with version `0.21.0`, the Gleam language server is built-in to the
`gleam` command-line interface.
[See the official announcement for more information.](https://gleam.run/news/v0.21-introducing-the-gleam-language-server/)

```sh
gleam lsp
```

### Go

The folder for go packages (typically $HOME/go/bin) will need to be added to
your PATH for any of the below to work.

#### Install tools

```
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest                            # LSP
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest                   # Debugger
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest                    # Formatter
go install github.com/nametake/golangci-lint-langserver@latest        # Linter
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest # Linter cli
```

#### Autoformatting

The LSP formatter (`gofmt`) does not fix imports, `goimports` should be used
instead.

`languages.toml`

```toml
[[language]]
name = "go"
auto-format = true
formatter = { command = "goimports" }
```

### GraphQL

https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphql-language-service-cli/

```sh
npm i -g graphql-language-service-cli
```

### Haskell

Haskell Language Server.

https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server

### Helm

The Helm-ls installation guide can be found under the "Getting Started" section
in the readme.

https://github.com/mrjosh/helm-ls#getting-started

### HTML

#### vscode-html-language-server

https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted

`vscode-html-language-server` can be installed via `npm`:

```sh
npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
```

#### superhtml

https://github.com/kristoff-it/superhtml

### Java

https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls

Installation instructions can be found on the
[projects README](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls).

On macOS installation can also be done via `brew install jdtls`.

On debian based distros try a fantastic install script made by
[eruizc-dev](https://github.com/eruizc-dev):
[jdtls-launcher](https://github.com/eruizc-dev/jdtls-launcher).

For the Arch Linux: `yay -Sy jdtls`
[AUR jdtls source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jdtls).

After installing, test to see if the `jdtls` works out of the box (it should
work for the debian script). For versions older than `1.16.0`: the `-data`
parameter must be passed to `jdtls` and it must be different for each project.
This can be achieved by adding a `.helix/languages.toml` configuration to the
project root:

```toml
[language-server]
jdtls = { command = "jdtls" }
language-server = { command = "jdtls", args = [
  "-data", "/home/<USER>/.cache/jdtls/workspace"
  ]}

[[language]]
name = "java"
scope = "source.java"
injection-regex = "java"
file-types = ["java"]
roots = ["pom.xml", "build.gradle", ]
indent = { tab-width = 4, unit = "    " }
language-servers = [ "jdtls" ]
```

Note: the `-data` parameter must be up one directory from the project directory.

### JavaScript

See
[tsserver](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Language-Server-Configurations#typescript).

### JSON

https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted

vscode-json-language-server, a language server for JSON and JSON schema

`vscode-json-language-server` can be installed via `npm`:

```sh
npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
```

Available settings can be found here:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4f69cdf95a12cef48d405b38bf7812a7f297c310/extensions/json-language-features/server/src/jsonServer.ts#L183

Usage

```toml
config = { "provideFormatter" = true, "json" = { "keepLines" = { "enable" = true } } }
```

### Jsonnet

https://github.com/grafana/jsonnet-language-server

A [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://langserver.org/) server for
[Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/).

Can be installed either via the
[latest release binary](https://github.com/grafana/jsonnet-language-server/releases)
or if you have golang installed, you can use:

```sh
go install github.com/grafana/jsonnet-language-server@latest
```

### Julia

https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl

LanguageServer.jl can be installed with `julia` and `Pkg`:

```sh
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("LanguageServer")'
```

To update an existing install, use the following command:

```sh
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.update()'
```

### Kotlin

A Kotlin language server which was developed for internal usage and released
afterward. Maintaining is not done by the original author, but by fwcd.

It is built via gradle and developed on GitHub. Source and additional
description: https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-language-server

### LaTex

[TexLab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab): A cross-platform implementation
of the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol)
providing rich cross-editing support for the
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) typesetting system.

Add the following to your languages.toml to enable build on save:

```toml
[language-server.texlab.config.texlab.build]
onSave = true
```

TexLab can be further configured to jump to your current location in the pdf
following the build, among other useful things. For all available options, see
the [TexLab wiki](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab/wiki/Configuration).
Everything under the `texlab` key goes under
`language-server.texlab.config.texlab` (or possibly `language.config.texlab` on
older releases). For instance, setting the `texlab.build.onSave` property to
`true` (as per the
[TexLab wiki](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab/wiki/Configuration#texlabbuildonsave))
is achieved with the above `languages.toml`.

### Lean 3

https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js/tree/master/lean-language-server

Lean installation instructions can be found
[here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install).

Once Lean is installed, you can install the Lean 3 language server by running

```sh
npm install -g lean-language-server
```

### Lua

Binaries are available from:
https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/releases

`mac`

```sh
brew install lua-language-server
```

### Markdoc

[@markdoc/language-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@markdoc/language-server) -
an experimental language server for markdoc. `markdoc-ls` should be available
after installation.

Install using

```sh
npm install -g @markdoc/language-server
```

### Markdown

#### Marksman

The default language server is Marksman:
https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman

Binaries are available from: https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/releases

`macOS and Linux`

```sh
brew install marksman or yay -S marksman-bin
```

`Windows`

```sh
scoop install marksman
```

#### ltex-ls

As an alternative you can use `ltex-ls` which provides grammar and spelling
errors in markup documents: https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/

```toml
[[language]]
name = "markdown"
language-servers = [ "marksman", "ltex-ls" ]
```

Additional configuration settings can be added, for example to disable the
profanity rules and add the word `builtin` to two dictionaries:

```toml
[language-server.ltex-ls.config]
ltex.disabledRules = { "en-US" = ["PROFANITY"], "en-GB" = ["PROFANITY"] }
ltex.dictionary = { "en-US" = ["builtin"], "en-GB" = ["builtin"] }
```

Currently,
[the ability to add to your user dictionary while running Helix is not supported](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls/issues/231),
so adding words to the config is the best workaround.

#### `markdown-oxide`

An alternative to `marksman` that provides support for advanced markdown PKM
systems in your favorite text editor. It features complete compatibility with
Obsidian.md markdown syntax and bases its features on the features of the
Obsidian.md editor. For a list of all features, check out the
[README](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide?tab=readme-ov-file#features)

- It can be installed for Arch from the AUR under the name `markdown-oxide-git`

```sh
paru -S markdown-oxide-git
```

- Or it can be installed by `cargo`

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide.git markdown-oxide
```

- Or manually by following
  [these directions](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-for-macos-windows-and-other-linux-distributions)

### MATLAB

[matlab-language-server](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-language-server)

[the project's releases page](https://github.com/bscan/PerlNavigator/releases)
and putting the perlnavigator executable somewhere in your PATH.

### Pest

https://github.com/pest-parser/pest-ide-tools

This repository contains an implementation of the Language Server Protocol in
Rust, for the Pest parser generator.

### PHP

#### Phpactor

https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html

Phpactor requires PHP 8.1.

You can download `phpactor.phar` as follows:

```sh
curl -Lo phpactor.phar https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/latest/download/phpactor.phar
```

Then make it executable and symlink it somewhere in your
[PATH](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>):

```sh
chmod a+x phpactor.phar
mv phpactor.phar ~/.local/bin/phpactor
```

Check support using the status command:

```sh
phpactor status
✔ Composer detected - faster class location and more features!
✔ Git detected - enables faster refactorings in your repository scope!
```

Then, to enable this LSP you have to create a file `languages.toml` in your
project directory `.helix/languages.toml` and place the following code inside
(or if you want you could do this to helix languages.toml file globally):

```toml
[language-server.phpactor]
command = "phpactor"
args = [ "language-server" ]
[[language]]
name = "php"
language-servers = [ "phpactor" ]
```

#### Intelephense

> [!WARNING]
> Intelephense is proprietary, so be sure to review its licensing terms.

https://intelephense.com

`intelephense` can be installed via `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g intelephense
```

##### Premium version

To enable the premium features you have to provide a license key for which you
have a few options:

1. Adding the license key directly to your languages.toml file:

```toml
[language-server.intelephense.config]
licenceKey = "MY_LICENSE_KEY"
```

2. Adding the path to your license file

```toml
[language-server.intelephense.config]
licenceKey = "/home/username/.config/intelephense/license.txt"
```

3. Adding the license file to your home directory under
   `$HOME/intelephense/licence.txt`

**Note**: Keep in mind how the word is written licen**c**eKey and not
licen**s**eKey, also for step 3) it has to be licen**c**e.txt.

### PKGBUILD

by the Spyder IDE team and the community. It is a Python 3.7+ implementation of
the

[Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)
(versions \<1.4 should still work with Python 3.6).

Installation instructions can be found in the
[project's README](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server#installation),
but it consists of installing a package using `pip` (or
[`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)):

```console
pip install -U 'python-lsp-server[all]'
```

The `[all]` above refers to the optional providers supported. You can fine-tune
what to install following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server#installation).

#### pylsp-mypy

[python-lsp/pylsp-mypy](https://github.com/python-lsp/pylsp-mypy) (`pylsp-mypy`) is a Mypy (type checker) plugin for Pylsp. First do the steps in Pylsp section and then install pylsp-mypy:

```console
pip install pylsp-mypy
```

`languages.toml`

```toml
[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = ["pylsp"]

[language-server.pylsp.config.pylsp]
plugins.pylsp_mypy.enabled = true
plugins.pylsp_mypy.live_mode = true
```

#### python-lsp-ruff

[python-lsp/python-lsp-ruff](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-ruff) is a
plugin for pylsp that provides support for [ruff (see below)](#ruff).

See [installation instructions](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-ruff#install).

An LSP for it is available through
[ruff-lsp](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) (see
[installation instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))
or [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) with arg `server`. Also check out
the
[ruff docs for integration with helix](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup/#helix).

A suggested Helix configuration using ruff as lsp is given below:

```toml
[language-server.ruff-lsp]
command = "ruff-lsp"
[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = [ "ruff-lsp" ]
```

or

```toml
[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = [ "ruff" ]
auto-format = true
[language-server.ruff]
command = "ruff"
args = ["server"]
```

**Note** that ruff lacks basic features and is meant to be used alongside
another LSP
([helix-editor/helix#5399 (comment)](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/5399#issuecomment-1373470899),
[charliermarsh/ruff-lsp#23](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-lsp/issues/23),
[charliermarsh/ruff-lsp#23 (comment)](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-lsp/issues/23#issuecomment-1367903296)).

As an alternative, [pylsp](#pylsp) has support for ruff via a plugin.
