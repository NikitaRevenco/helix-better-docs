Concrete examples showing how powerful multiple cursor functionality can be.

## Object to Array of (key, value)

<T.InitialStateJs />

We want to transform this object into an array of tuples where, the first element of each tuple is the key of the object and the second element is the value:

<T.FinalStateJs />

Steps:

1. Inside the object, use <kbd>mr\{[</kbd> to replace the surrounding `{` with `[`:

<T.ReplacedCurliesWithSquare />

2. <kbd>mi[</kbd> to select inside the entire array:

<T.SelectedInsideArray />

3. <kbd>s</kbd> to enter select mode, then <kbd>:</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> will place a cursor on every `:`.

<T.CursorOnEachColon />

4. <kbd>r,</kbd> replaces each selection with a `,`. A cursor is line a single-width selection, and we have multiple cursors, so it will replace each `:` with `,`.

<T.ReplacedColonsWithCommas />

5. <kbd>t,</kbd> moves the cursor on each line to the ending comma.

<T.MovedCursorToEnd />

6. <kbd>;</kbd> the selection around each cursor into a single selection.

<T.CollapsedAllSelections />

7. <kbd>vgs</kbd> selects each line excluding the final comma.

<T.SelectEachLine />

8. <kbd>ms[</kbd> surrounds each individual selection with `[` to turn it into an array.

<T.SurroundEachWithArray />

9. <kbd>l</kbd> moves 1 character forward, replacing the selection with just a 1-width selection:

<T.MoveOneCharForward />

10. <kbd>e</kbd> selects until the end of each word.

<T.SelectUntilEndOfEachWord />

11. <kbd>ms"</kbd> surrounds the items with double quotes to make strings.

<T.AddedSurroundingQuotations />

The final command to achieve all of that is `mr{[mi[s:<enter>r,t,;vgsms[lems"`.
